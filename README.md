### ðŸ§  Text-to-SQL and Chat-with-Anything

This project is an AI-powered assistant that can do two main things:

Text to SQL â€“ You can type your question in normal English, and it will automatically turn it into a proper PostgreSQL query and run it on your database.

Chat with Files â€“ You can upload PDF, TXT, CSV, or DOCX files and ask questions about their content.

You can use it either from the command line (CLI) or with a Streamlit web interface.


### ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Convert natural language into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL)
âœ… Connect and run queries on your PostgreSQL database
âœ… Upload and chat with multiple file types (PDF, TXT, CSV, DOCX)
âœ… Works with Groqâ€™s Llama 3.1 model for fast AI responses
âœ… Includes both terminal and Streamlit web app versions
âœ… Easy to set up using environment variables

### ðŸ§  Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Streamlit â€“ for the web interface

LangChain + Groq LLM (Llama 3.1) â€“ for text-to-SQL and file Q&A

SQLAlchemy + psycopg2 â€“ for database access

PyPDF2, python-docx, pandas â€“ for reading uploaded files

### ðŸª¶ Example

### Question:

Show me all employees who joined after January 2023.

Generated SQL:

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE join_date > '2023-01-01';

âš¡ Notes

Make sure your database is running before using the Text-to-SQL feature.

Youâ€™ll need a valid Groq API key to use the AI models.

Large PDFs or image-based files may not extract text perfectly.
